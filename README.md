# Macropad-v1.1
This repo will be sent to HackClub. This attempt is much better than the first one!
Actually this project name is Sledge. I don't know why I named the repo "Macropad...."

Sledge features 6 keys (one of them is 1.75mm long), 1 rotary encoder, and 1 OLED screen.

## CAD model

This case consists of 3 printed parts - Bottom, plate, and the top cover. Apart from these, I've made cap for the rotary encoder, as I thought it would be boring and somewhat uncomfortable to use it.
